## Chronology
1. Paleo-Indian
> The prefix "paleo-" comes from the Greek adjective palaios (παλαιός), meaning "old" or "ancient".  

* This is a classification term given by scholars to the first peoples who entered, and subsequently inhabited, the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period. 

* Human during this period lived on hunting big animals and collecting fruits.

2. Archaic (8000 – 2000 BC)
> This word, originating from Greek, means "from the beginning, antiquated, ancient, old".

* It is characterized by *the rise of incipient agriculture* in Mesoamerica: Cultivation of wild plants -> informal 
domestication -> culminating with sedentism and agricultural production.

* Domestication of cacao, maize(corn), beans, tomato, avocado, vanilla, squash and chili.

* Domestication of dog, duck and turkey,

3. Preclassic/Formative (2000 BC – 250 AD)

* The __earliest__ one is `Omlec culture` (1200 - 400 BC), which inhabited the __Gulf Coast of Mexico__ and extended inland and southwards 
across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

* Later, other cultures were also developed in __Maya area__, __valley of Oaxaca__ and __central Mexico__.

* `Monte Alban` and `Teotihuacan` (which superseded many other small sites, eg. `Cuicuilco`) were developed in this period.

4. Classic (200 – 900 AD)

* It is marked by the *rise and dominance of several polities*.

* __Early classic (200–600 AD)__ Of paramount importance are `Teotihuacán` in __central Mexico__ and `Tikal` in __Guatemala (Maya area)__. 
`Monte Alban` in __Oaxaca__ is another Classic-period polity that expanded and flourished during this period

* __Late classic (600–900 AD)__ It is characterized as a period of *interregional competition and factionalization* among the numerous 
regional polities in the __Maya area__. Main results: the decrease in `Tikal`’s socio-political and economic power and the rise of other
sites.

* __Terminal classic (800–900/1000 AD)__ Generally applied to the __Maya area__. It generally correlates with the rise to prominence 
of Puuc settlements in the northern Maya lowlands. `Chichén Itzá` is thought to rise to its prominence in this period. 
Strong connection between __central Mexico__ and __Maya area__ were developed.
> The word "puuc" is derived from the Maya term for "hill".

5. Postclassic (900 – 1519 AD)

* __Maya area__: characterized by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of various polities. `Chichén Itzá` -> `Mayapán` -> 
competing large cities.

* __central Mexico__: `Toltec`(at Hidalgo),  `Cholula`(contemporaneous with `Teotihuacan` but continued to Postclassic) -> 
`Aztez empire` (which conquered this whole region including Oaxaca)
